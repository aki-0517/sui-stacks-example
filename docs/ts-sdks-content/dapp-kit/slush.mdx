title: Slush Integration
---

dApp Kit provides out-of-the-box opt-in support for the [Slush wallet](../slush-wallet/dapp).

## Setup

To enable support for Slush wallets, pass the `slushWallet` object to the `WalletProvider`
component. This object has the following properties:

- **`name`** - The name of your dApp, shown to the user when connecting to the dApp.

```tsx
function App({ children }) {
	return (
		<WalletProvider
			slushWallet={{
				name: 'Your dApp name',
			}}
		>
			{children}
		</WalletProvider>
	);
}
```

<Callout>
	Note: In the connect modal, users with the Slush Wallet extension installed will only see the
	extension. If they donâ€™t have it, the connection will default to the Slush web app.
</Callout>
